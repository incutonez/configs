Dumping grounds for configuration based files and functionality

## scaffold
The scaffolding [main.ts](https://github.com/incutonez/configs/blob/main/scaffold/main.ts) script will create a starter project in either Vue or React, with the additional configurations that I like to use... like Tailwind, Material Symbols (for icons), ESLint/Stylistic settings, etc.  It's just a bunch of boilerplate that I forget about each time I need a new project, and I wanted to automate that.
